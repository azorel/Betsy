# Betsy
Betsy is a 1986 Dodge Ram B250 Camper Van. This project is for the development of the Raspberry Pi 3b+ that I have added to it. 

Some of the Goals are to use the power of the raspberry pi, to by an assistant to keeping things in check as well as log aspects.

Other goals are to add things that I think that other may want to try to use as tools for thier travels in there digitalnomadic life.

Myself, I'm a NEWB. Have no formal training, schooling, in programming unless you count Turbo Pascal 7.0 in 1996. Excel / SQL I have some 
knowledge in. Multi projects based on it, and ideas. I like to come up with idea's, and pass them on to others to fullfil. This project
is for one of those ideas. If bad programming or grammar or spelling makes you mad, please hit the home button. If you would like to help
